      <h2>Whoami 🧑‍💻</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Syarif, a Software Engineering student who enjoys working on clean, functional,
        and efficient digital experiences. I spend most of my time exploring web development,
        customizing Linux systems, and digging into the basics of cybersecurity. I like building
        streamlined workflows—whether through tweaking distros, optimizing editors, or experimenting
        with different development setups. I focus best with subtle background noise and usually work
        in deep-work cycles with micro breaks. Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, watching anime,
        photography, and tweaking systems just for the fun of breaking and fixing things.
